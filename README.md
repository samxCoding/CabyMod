## What is CabyMod?
CabyMod is a Fabric Mod that goes into Fabric's Mod Loader Folder: mods
It's also very simple to install, since it's just in a terminal!


## How do I install CabyMod?
First put the Minecraft Launcher app in the same folder as the application,
After that once opening the application, you need to wait then once it's ready your able to type. Then type this command:
```
Minecraft Launcher
```
or just type the name of the application.
When you do that, it should start analizing the Launcher and modifing configs in Minecraft Launcher
## Do I look out for anything?
Yes, if your process says [BUILD COMPLETE] The build was sucessfully completed.
If it says [BUILD FAILED] then relaunch the application, if you don't lunar client will have more crashes(some incidents its okay)
A problem one is [JAVA BUILD FAILED], this means something happened to the following:
  | You selected a version lower then 1.15 (1.8.9 still works)
  | To much texture packs selected (Don't use more then 25 Resource Packs)
  | Java is not working correctly (Reinstall a newer or same Java version)
<sup> That is all the sollutions and problems! </sup>

## What do I need for CabyMod?
Minecraft Launcher
Essentials Mod ( Use the Essentials Mod Installation for better loading)
Sodium, Exordium, Phorshor and Reese's Sodium Options (Reese's Sodium Options is totally optional, we will just use our config)
Depending on your version, it can impact your fps on your version.


## What to expect? What will be on my computer?
Your computer will be installing the following:
| A config file.
| The official CabyMod.jar 
```
The official CabyMod.jar is most likely in it's first version.
```
