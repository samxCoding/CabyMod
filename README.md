## What is LabyMod?
LabyMod is a Client Upgrader for two many used clients: LabyMod and Lunar Client!
It's also very simple to install, since it's just in a terminal!

## How do I install CabyMod?
Download the latest release, after that open the application, and now here is what you should do:
IDN means Lunar Client's or LabyMod's name. It's normally Lunar Client.app or LabyMod Launcher.app
sh2: is a valid process!
If you do NOT recieve sh2 or sh1 your console/client has officially crashed. Don't worry just wait until it finishes and try again!
## Do I look out for anything?
Yes, if your process says [BUILD COMPLETE] The build was sucessfully completed.
If it says [BUILD FAILED] then relaunch the application, if you don't lunar client will have more crashes(some incidents its okay)
A problem one is [JAVA BUILD FAILED], this means something happened to the following:
  | You selected a version lower then 1.15 (1.8.9 still works)
  | Might have selected Optifine + Lunar (Please use Fabric + Lunar)
  | To much texture packs selected (Don't use more then 25 Resource Packs)
  | Java is not working correctly (Reinstall a newer or same Java version)
  | Non-Stable Lunar Client/LabyMod application (Try reinstalling LabyMod or Lunar Client)
<sup> That is all the sollutions and problems! </sup>

## What do I need for CabyMod?
A valid client 
Lunar Client or LabyMod,
LabyMod isn't supported yet!
Java Installed, no OpenJDK needed.
Lunar Client can be cracked, do **NOT** try to use a cracked account, as your pc can get a solid crash.

## What to expect? What will be on my computer?
Your computer will be installing the following:
| A config file.
| The official CabyMod.jar 
```
The official CabyMod.jar is most likely in it's first version.
```

## What are the benefits using this client?
Insane FPS boost, averaging around 500+ FPS on a INTEL MacBook. (Notice, CabyMod is made for MacOS only.)
Faster Mods ! | The mods on Lunar Client or LabyMod(Laby's Widgets) will barely impact your FPS!
Optimized Sodium | Sodium is just going to be Sodium's original rendering, but with CabyMod, the client will just look for Sodiums **Main File** to make it faster!
